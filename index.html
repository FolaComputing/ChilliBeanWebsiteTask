          <h1>The Special Relationship</h1>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 5%;">Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States have ranged from close allies to military opponents since the latter declared independence from the former in the late 18th century.</p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 5%;">The United States surpassed its former parent as the world's leading power during the World Wars, having overshadowed it economically from the late 19th century. Since 1940 the countries have been close military allies enjoying the Special Relationship built as wartime allies and NATO partners.</p>
          <p style="padding-bottom: 5%;">The two countries also have had a significant impact of the cultures of many other countries. They are the two main nodes of the Anglosphere, with a combined population of just under 400 million in 2019. Together, they have given the English language a dominant role in many sectors of the modern world.</p>
